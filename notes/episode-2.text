now change our index.html where we inject CDN lins to get react into our app we have to remove CDN's coz this is 
not preferable way to worked. >>>>

we will not use react using CDN's , we will use this command for react  --npm install react and npm install react-dom--ðŸ™„

after that we can remove the cdns from index.html ----

exicuting the app using npx command showing an error---
